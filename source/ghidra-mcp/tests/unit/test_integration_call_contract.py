"""Every integration test's HTTP call must be one the catalog can serve.

Why this exists
---------------
The read-only integration suite shipped ten calls the server does not support:
parameters spelled wrong, one endpoint GET-ed that is declared POST, and three
endpoints that do not exist at all. Every one of them still passed. A live
Ghidra answers 200 for an undeclared parameter -- ``AnnotationScanner`` simply
does not find it and uses the default -- and the tests that hit a missing route
had already been written to accept ``[200, 404]``, so the permanent 404 was
indistinguishable from success. Ten tests asserting nothing, green for years.

The offline HTTP tier (#112) can see this, but only for the one file it
replays, and only when a fixture exists to drive the call. This check is the
cheap, total version:

* pure AST, no server, no fixtures, no Ghidra -- so it runs in the unit tier
  that CI always executes, on every integration file at once;
* it fails on a call that could not possibly work, which is a defect in the
  test whatever the server is doing.

Source of truth is ``tests/endpoints.json`` for routing and method, and
``tests/conformance/snapshots/mcp_schema.snap`` for declared parameters. PR
#459 settled that the ``@McpTool``/``@Param`` annotations are authoritative and
made regeneration stop copying stale catalog values forward, so a test calling
a route that is not there is a broken test, not a missing feature.

The baseline
------------
``fixtures/known_integration_call_breaches.json`` **is empty and must stay
empty**. It held the 29 breaches this check found outside the read-only suite
on its first run; they were paid off in #475. It is a ratchet in both
directions: a new breach fails, and so does a stale entry, so fixing one means
deleting its line. It is not an exemption list -- a line here is a decision to
ship a test that cannot fail.

What the first pass over those 29 taught the check itself, all fixed here:

* ``by_path.get("/set_global")`` is a dict lookup over the endpoint catalog,
  not an HTTP GET. Three of the 29 were this -- ``method_not_allowed`` reported
  against POST endpoints no test ever called with GET. A checker that
  manufactures breaches teaches people to edit the baseline, so receivers are
  now classified and an unclassified one fails loudly.
* ``http_client.post`` takes ``json_data=``, not ``json=``. Every JSON body in
  the tier was invisible; four real breaches were hiding there.
* ``http_session.get(f"{server_url}/list_functions", params=...)`` was not
  parsed at all, hiding a fifth.
* ``tests/conftest.py`` is not in ``tests/integration/`` but supplies the
  tier's shared fixtures, and two of them made the same bad call -- inherited
  by every test that asks for them.

Each of those is the same failure this file exists to catch, one level up: a
check that quietly sees less than it claims to.
