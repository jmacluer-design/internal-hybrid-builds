"""The gate that stops a release publishing on a regression that never ran.

Context
-------
``release.yml`` and ``pre-release.yml`` gated publishing on::

    needs.release-regression.result == 'success' || == 'skipped'

On a **tag push** that job is always skipped -- its own ``if`` requires
``workflow_dispatch`` -- so ``skipped`` was the only value a tagged release ever
produced, and the gate had never once blocked one.

It cannot be fixed by running the tier in CI. It needs a live Ghidra GUI on
Windows and targets ``[self-hosted, Windows]``; **no self-hosted runner is
registered**, and that is deliberate -- on a public repository, labelling a fork
PR would run a stranger's code on the maintainer's machine. So the gate is
recorded local evidence, and these tests are what stop that record being
reduced to a formality.
