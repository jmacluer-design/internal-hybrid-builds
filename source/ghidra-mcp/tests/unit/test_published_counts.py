"""Every published tool/endpoint count must agree with ``tests/endpoints.json``.

The catalog is the authoritative repo snapshot. Before this file existed, six
surfaces disagreed with it and with each other at the same commit:
``README.md`` said 272 in one place and 253 in another, ``extension.properties``
said 267, ``AGENTS.md`` said 267, ``CLAUDE.md``'s Tool Inventory said 272 while
its own overview said 253, and ``docs/releases/README.md`` described 7.0.0 as
shipping 251. Nothing compared them, so each one drifted on its own schedule.

Three rules, all learned from release notes that published a wrong number:

1. **Counts are derived, never restated.** Everything here comes from
   ``tools.audit_server_scope.release_counts()`` -- the same function
   ``.github/workflows/release.yml`` reads. A literal in this file would be a
   seventh place to drift.

2. **Nothing gets a fallback.** ``release.yml`` once grepped a deleted file with
   ``|| echo "0"`` and published ``Headless Endpoints: 1`` for two releases
   running, because a suppressed read error looked like a legitimate number. So
   a marker that cannot be found here is a **failure**, not a skip: a reworded
   sentence must fail loudly and say which pattern stopped matching, because a
   pattern that silently matches nothing is a test that cannot fail.

3. **The count is not one number.** The two HTTP servers do not serve the same
   routes, so a figure is only meaningful once you say what it counts. Each
   assertion below names which of the four it is pinning.

Runs offline: no Ghidra, no network, no build.
