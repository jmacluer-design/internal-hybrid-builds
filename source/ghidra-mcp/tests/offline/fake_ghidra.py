"""A strict, catalog-driven fake of the Ghidra plugin's HTTP surface.

Issue #112. The integration tier needs a live Ghidra on :8089 with a binary
open, so CI can only ever run the thin offline tier and an outside contributor
cannot self-verify anything that touches the wire. This module is the missing
half: an HTTP server that answers the documented endpoints, so the bridge --
the real ``bridge_mcp_ghidra`` package, unmodified -- can be driven end to end
with no Ghidra installed.

What makes it a *strict* fake, and why that matters
---------------------------------------------------
The obvious design is a response replayer: record real traffic, play it back.
A replayer can only ever say **yes**. It hands the recorded body to whatever
asks, so a caller that used the wrong HTTP method, invented an endpoint, or put
a query parameter in the JSON body still gets ``200`` and the test still
passes. That is precisely the failure mode this repo has already been bitten by
-- a green suite that cannot go red.

So the fake is built the other way round. Its *behaviour* is derived from the
repo's own machine-checked contract:

* ``tests/endpoints.json``                      -- the routing table (253 endpoints)
* ``tests/conformance/snapshots/mcp_schema.snap`` -- the parameter contract
  (239 tools, each parameter carrying its declared ``source``: ``query`` or
  ``body``)

and only its *payloads* come from recordings (the 119 conformance snapshots,
captured from real Ghidra against the disposable benchmark binaries).

That split is the whole point. The fake refuses:

* an endpoint that is not in the catalog                       -> 404
* a method the catalog does not declare for that path          -> 405
* a parameter the schema does not declare                      -> 400
* a ``source: query`` parameter that arrived in the JSON body  -> 400

The last one is not hypothetical. ``@Param(value = "program")`` defaults to
``ParamSource.QUERY``, so every POST endpoint must send ``program`` as a URL
query parameter; a bridge that puts it in the body targets the server's
*current* program instead of the one the caller named -- a wrong-binary write,
silently successful. Against a replayer that regression is invisible. Here it
is a 400.

What this CANNOT prove
----------------------
Read ``tests/offline/README.md`` before adding a test here. In one line: this
proves the bridge speaks the protocol correctly and that response shapes match
what Ghidra really returned when the snapshots were recorded. It proves nothing
whatsoever about whether Ghidra does the right thing today. Recorded payloads
are frozen -- change a Java service's response shape and this tier stays green
until somebody re-records. Anything that claims more than it verifies is worse
than nothing.

Prior art
---------
``mad-sol-dev/GhidraMCPd`` (Apache-2.0) ships ``tests/fixtures/reference.bin``
plus ``scripts/reference_mcp_server.py``, a FastMCP stub that serves a
fixture-backed client over stdio for smoke tests. No code is taken from it.
The design differs deliberately: their stub substitutes for the *Ghidra client*
and is driven over the MCP layer, which means the bridge's HTTP transport,
dispatch and schema code never execute. This fake sits one layer lower, at the
HTTP boundary, so all of that code is the code under test.
