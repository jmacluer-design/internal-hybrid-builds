# Offline HTTP tier

**No Ghidra required.** Run the HTTP surface, the bridge, and most of the
read-only integration suite on a laptop with nothing installed but Python.

```bash
# the tier's own tests: the fake, and the real bridge driven through it
uv run --frozen --group test pytest tests/offline/ --no-cov

# the read-only INTEGRATION suite -- the one that needs a live Ghidra on
# :8089 with a binary open -- run with no Ghidra at all
uv run --frozen --group test pytest tests/integration/test_readonly_endpoints.py \
    -p tests.offline.replay_plugin --no-cov

# or drive the fake yourself, from anything
python -m tests.offline.fake_ghidra --port 18089
```

Both run in CI on every pull request (`Offline HTTP Tier (no Ghidra)` in
`.github/workflows/tests.yml`) and both gate `build-status`.

## What this proves

1. **The bridge speaks the protocol correctly.** `tests/unit/` covers the
   bridge by patching `transport.do_request` and `dispatch.dispatch_get`, so
   the code that decides *what goes on the wire* is only ever checked against a
   mock's idea of the server. Here the real `bridge_mcp_ghidra` package fetches
   a real `/mcp/schema` over a real socket, registers 200+ tools from it,
   builds real handlers, and issues real requests. Schema parsing, handler
   construction, query-vs-body routing, address sanitisation, `allow_empty`,
   synthetic `dry_run`, the retry ladder and the never-retry-a-write rule all
   execute for real.

2. **Callers obey the endpoint contract.** The fake routes from
   `tests/endpoints.json` (219 endpoints) and checks parameters against the
   recorded `/mcp/schema` (205 tools, each parameter carrying its declared
   `source`). The 14 catalogued endpoints the recording does not cover get
   routing and **no parameter check at all** — correct and permanent, because
   all 14 are the headless-only project-management surface and the snapshot is
   a recording of the *GUI* server. `test_fake_ghidra.py`'s
   `SCHEMA_RECORDING_PREDATES` is the ratchet on that: it is **empty**, and a
   GUI-served endpoint the recording does not cover fails there. Four were in
   that state until the snapshot was re-recorded at the 2026-09-18 deploy
   (235 → 239 tools): `/move_file` and `/move_folder`, headless-only when the
   snapshot was taken and made GUI-served by 7.0.0, plus
   `/list_shadowed_globals` and `/batch_get_comments`, added after it. The fix
   is always to re-record against a deployed server, which needs a live
   Ghidra. It refuses an endpoint that is not catalogued, a method the
   catalog does not declare, a parameter the schema does not declare, and — the
   one it exists for — a `source: query` parameter that arrived in the JSON
   body. `@Param(value = "program")` defaults to `ParamSource.QUERY`; sent in
   the body it is ignored and the plugin falls back to the *current* program,
   which is a wrong-binary write that reports success.

3. **Response shapes match what Ghidra really returned.** Payloads come from
   `tests/conformance/snapshots/`, captured from a live Ghidra against the
   disposable benchmark binaries. A contributor whose new assertion is simply
   wrong about the shape finds out without installing anything.

## What this does NOT prove

**It proves nothing about whether Ghidra does the right thing.** Not partially,
not indirectly. The recorded payloads are frozen: change a Java service's
response shape and this tier stays green until somebody re-records the
snapshots. Nothing here executes a single line of the plugin.

Concretely, the following remain live-only and always will be:

| Question | Why the fake cannot answer it |
| --- | --- |
| Does `/decompile_function` decompile correctly? | The fake replays one recorded decompilation. It never runs the decompiler. |
| Did a write actually land in the Ghidra database? | Nothing is written. Every write endpoint returns its recorded receipt. |
| Does a transaction commit? | There is no database. |
| Does an endpoint honour a parameter? | The fake serves ONE recorded response per endpoint. It validates that a parameter is *declared*; it cannot tell whether the server *acts* on it. |
| Did a Java service's response shape change? | Only re-recording the snapshots can reveal that. |

If a test in this tier looks like it is answering one of those, it is asserting
on the fixtures, not on Ghidra. That is worse than no test. Two guards exist to
make it hard to do by accident:

* An endpoint with no recording returns a body stamped
  `"_fake": "synthesized"` with a note saying assertions on it prove nothing.
* Hand-written responses live in `fixtures/session_responses.json`, apart from
  the recordings, with a README block saying they are not evidence.

## Design: why a strict fake and not a response replayer

The obvious build is a replayer — record traffic, play it back. **A replayer
can only ever say yes.** It hands the recorded body to whatever asks, so a
caller using the wrong method, an invented endpoint, or a query parameter in
the JSON body still gets `200` and the test still passes. That is a green suite
that cannot go red, which is the exact failure this repo has been bitten by
before.

So behaviour and payload are split:

* **Behaviour** is derived from the repo's own machine-checked artifacts —
  `tests/endpoints.json` for routing, the `mcp_schema.snap` for the parameter
  contract. Generic across all 219 endpoints; nothing hand-maintained.
* **Payloads** come from the 119 committed conformance snapshots. Free,
  already normalised for the repo's data-egress guard, and regenerated by an
  existing tool (`python -m tests.conformance.run_conformance --update-snapshots`).

The value is in the refusals. A hand-written stub would drift silently; a
replayer would never refuse anything.

### Prior art

`mad-sol-dev/GhidraMCPd` (Apache-2.0) ships `tests/fixtures/reference.bin` and
`scripts/reference_mcp_server.py`, a FastMCP stub serving a fixture-backed
client over stdio for smoke tests. No code is taken from it. Their stub
substitutes for the *Ghidra client* and is driven over the MCP layer, so the
bridge's HTTP transport, dispatch and schema code never execute. This fake sits
one layer lower, at the HTTP boundary, so all of that code is the code under
test.

## Two strictness modes

| Mode | Contract breach | Used by |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `strict=True` (default) | 4xx at the wire | `test_bridge_end_to_end.py` — the bridge is under test and must never breach |
| `strict=False` | recorded to `server.violations`, request served | `replay_plugin.py` — the existing integration suite was written against a live server that tolerates undeclared parameters |

Leniency is not forgiveness. Refusing at the first breach aborts a shared
fixture and hides everything behind it — one undeclared `limit=` on
`/list_functions` skipped 18 later tests through `first_function_address`.
Recording lets the whole suite execute and yields the *complete* violation set,
which `pytest_sessionfinish` then asserts against
`fixtures/expected_contract_violations.json`. A new violation fails CI. So does
a stale one, so a fix has to be recorded.

## The two baseline files

* **`fixtures/expected_contract_violations.json`** — calls the read-only suite
  makes that the catalog does not support. Against a live Ghidra each still
  returns 200 (the plugin ignores parameters it does not declare), so the test
  passes while asserting nothing about the thing its name claims. **It is
  empty**: the ten found on this tier's first run were fixed, and it should
  stay empty. A line here is a decision to ship a test that cannot fail.
* **`fixtures/known_offline_gaps.json`** — integration tests that structurally
  cannot run here, each with its cause: `recording_gap` (the variant response
  was never recorded) or `bad_fixture` (the snapshot is a captured error). The
  third cause, `missing_route`, is retired — a test calling a route that does
  not exist is a broken test, and `tests/unit/test_integration_call_contract.py`
  now fails CI on one rather than letting it be quarantined. A listed node id
  that no longer exists is a hard ERROR, so the list cannot rot into an excuse.

## The declared-alias seam

`@Param` carries an `aliases` array that `AnnotationScanner` honours at
dispatch, but `ParamDescriptor.toJson` never emits — so `/mcp/schema` advertises
only the canonical name, and anything checking calls against the schema alone
calls a valid back-compat spelling an unknown parameter.
`param_aliases.py` reads the annotations directly to close that gap, and both
the fake and the static contract check use it. It fails safe: a broken parse
finds *fewer* aliases, which turns valid calls back into breaches and reddens
the ratchet, and `test_param_aliases.py` pins the known alias sets exactly so it
cannot fail the other way. The real fix is upstream — emit `aliases` in the
schema, and this module goes away.

## Extending this

Adding an endpoint to the fake: nothing to do. It routes from
`tests/endpoints.json`, so a new `@McpTool` is served as soon as the catalog is
regenerated. It will return a `synthesized` marker until a snapshot exists —
record one with `python -m tests.conformance.run_conformance --tier read
--record` against a live Ghidra.

Pointing another suite at the fake: add `-p tests.offline.replay_plugin`. The
plugin boots the fake, sets `GHIDRA_MCP_URL`, and `tests/conftest.py` does the
rest. Nothing in `tests/integration/` needs editing — deliberately, so the same
files keep running against a live Ghidra unchanged.

**Never bind port 8089.** The fake defaults to an ephemeral port so a
contributor's own Ghidra is never touched and two runs can overlap.
