"""Pin the @Param alias extractor.

The extractor exists to stop the contract checks calling a valid back-compat
spelling a breach (see ``tests/offline/param_aliases``). It can fail in two
directions and only one of them is safe:

* finding TOO FEW aliases turns valid calls into breaches -- loud, and the
  ratchet goes red;
* finding an alias that is not really declared EXCUSES a real breach -- silent,
  and it is the failure mode this file is here to prevent.

So the known alias sets are asserted exactly, not merely as a subset.
