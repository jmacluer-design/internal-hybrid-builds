# GitHub Workflows

This directory contains the maintained CI, release, and live-regression
workflows for GhidraMCP.

## Workflows

| Workflow | Trigger | Runner | Purpose |
| ---------- | --------- | -------- | --------- |
| `tests.yml` | Push and pull request to `main`/`dev`/`develop` | GitHub-hosted Ubuntu/Windows | Merge-gating build, unit, offline Java, Pester, and docs checks. |
| `codeql.yml` | Push/PR to `main`/`dev`, weekly schedule | GitHub-hosted | CodeQL security analysis. |
| `scorecard.yml` | Push to `dev`, weekly schedule, manual | GitHub-hosted | OSSF Scorecard supply-chain score. |
| `release-regression.yml` | Manual, reusable workflow call, PR label | Self-hosted Windows | Live Ghidra deploy regression. |
| `release.yml` | Version tags or manual dispatch | GitHub-hosted, optional self-hosted regression | Stable release artifact creation. |
| `pre-release.yml` | Manual dispatch | GitHub-hosted, optional self-hosted regression | Pre-release artifact creation. |

## Pull Request Gates

`tests.yml` runs automatically on pull requests and is the default merge gate.
Configure branch protection to require its status checks.

The live Ghidra regression is opt-in on pull requests. Add this PR label:

```text
live-ghidra-regression
```

When the label is present, `release-regression.yml` runs on a self-hosted
Windows runner and executes:

```text
python -m tools.setup deploy --ghidra-path <path> --test <tier>
```

This is not enabled for every PR by default because public GitHub-hosted runners
do not have the required active Ghidra project, and external PRs should not hang
waiting for a private self-hosted runner.

All eight tiers run from this repository. Six of them reset the benchmark
fixture first (`release`, `benchmark-read`, `benchmark-write`, `multi-program`,
`debugger-live`, `negative-contract`); that fixture is committed under
`tests/fixtures/benchmark/` and is generated, not compiled, so the runner needs
no toolchain. The workflow verifies the committed binaries still match their
generator before it builds anything.

> **History.** From 2026-08-10 to 2026-08-31 those six tiers all raised in
> `reset_benchmark_fixture()`: `fun-doc/` moved to the `d2-game-exe` repository
> and took the fixture with it, leaving only `endpoint-catalog` and
> `selected-contract` working — neither of which touches a program. `release`
> is this workflow's default tier, so its default configuration was dead for
> three weeks.

> **`debugger-live` is a partial restoration.** Its debuggee fixture is back and
> runnable, but the tier also needs a Ghidra GUI, a working dbgeng backend and
> `ghidratrace` in the launcher's interpreter. Where those are missing it raises
> `DebuggerLiveTestSkipped`, and inside `release` that is caught and reported.
> The `release` tier's pass line names the outcome so a skip cannot read as a
> pass.

## Release Gates

`release.yml` and `pre-release.yml` expose a `run_live_regression` input. Enable
it when a self-hosted Windows runner is available and you want the release job to
wait for the live regression before publishing.

The release regression workflow expects:

- Ghidra installed on the self-hosted runner.
- Java 21, Python 3.13, and Maven.
- Access to the target Ghidra project.
- Any `.env` credentials needed by the project or Ghidra Server.

See [docs/TESTING.md](../../docs/TESTING.md) for the full testing model,
commands, side effects, and runner/container notes.
