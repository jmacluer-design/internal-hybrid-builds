 * (only one retried, only one waited, one skipped programs the others saved).
 *
 * <p><b>The race.</b> {@link AutoAnalysisManager} schedules its own "Auto Analysis"
 * task whenever a program changes, independent of anything this server calls. If
 * that task's transaction is still open when {@code save()} runs, the save throws
 * {@code IOException("Unable to lock due to active transaction")}. Waiting for
 * analysis first narrows the window but does not close it -- Ghidra logs the task as
 * complete and the save's lock failure in the same instant -- so the save retries
 * with a short backoff on exactly that message.
