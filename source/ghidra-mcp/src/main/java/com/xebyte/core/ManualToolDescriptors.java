/**
 * Hand-authored {@link AnnotationScanner.ToolDescriptor}s for HTTP routes that are
 * registered directly via {@code createContext}/{@code safeContext} in
 * {@link com.xebyte.GhidraMCPPlugin} and/or
 * {@link com.xebyte.headless.GhidraMCPHeadlessServer}, rather than discovered via
 * {@code @McpTool} reflection (utility/server/project/tool routes that predate the
 * annotation-scanner convention). Without this registry these routes are fully live
 * and callable but invisible in {@code /mcp/schema} -- the Python bridge's dynamic
 * tool discovery reads only that schema, so an AI agent connected through the bridge
 * could never see or call them (found via a live-schema-vs-catalog diff, v6.0.0).
 *
 * <p>Path/method/category/description/params are sourced verbatim from
 * {@code tests/endpoints.json}'s hand-registered entries (see
 * {@code RegenerateEndpointsJson}'s "preserved (hand-registered)" merge rule --
 * that file is the existing source of truth for these routes' metadata). The
 * param NAMES come from there and their source is inferred from the route's HTTP
 * method (GET -&gt; query, POST -&gt; body); the catalog does not track per-param
 * type/required detail for hand-registered routes, and every one of these handlers
 * already parses its own params permissively, so marking them optional-string is
 * accurate enough for tool discovery without overclaiming precision the source
 * data doesn't have.
 *
 * <p>The param DESCRIPTIONS, by contrast, are written here against what the
 * handlers actually do, because there is nowhere else for them to come from: an
 * {@code @McpTool} method gets them from {@code @Param(description = ...)}, and a
 * hand-registered route has no annotation at all. Several of these parameters are
 * mode-dependent (the GUI plugin drives the already-open project and ignores the
 * repository selector; the headless server holds a real server connection and
 * reads it) or accepted and never read, and the descriptions say which.
 *
 * <p>{@code ManualToolDescriptorsParityTest} enforces that every path a server
 * registers manually has an entry here, so a future added route can't silently
 * repeat this gap.
