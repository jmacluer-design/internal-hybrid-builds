# Tools Directory

Utility scripts and tooling for the Ghidra MCP Server project.

## What's here

```

## Looking for the function-documentation CLI?

Three older scripts (`scan_undocumented_functions.py`,
`scan_functions_mcp.py`, `document_function.py`) used to live here.
They were archived to
[`docs/archive/legacy-tools/`](../docs/archive/legacy-tools/) in v5.10.
Automated function documentation is not part of this repository: drive
the MCP tools directly from your AI client (see
[`docs/prompts/FUNCTION_DOC_WORKFLOW_V5.md`](../docs/prompts/FUNCTION_DOC_WORKFLOW_V5.md))
or from your own orchestration on top of the HTTP API.

## Setup CLI

The `setup/` package is the actively maintained tooling. Use it for
every build/deploy/release flow:

```bash
# show all subcommands
python -m tools.setup --help

# common ones
python -m tools.setup build
python -m tools.setup preflight      --ghidra-path F:\ghidra_12.1.4_PUBLIC
python -m tools.setup deploy         --ghidra-path F:\ghidra_12.1.4_PUBLIC
python -m tools.setup bump-version   --new 5.10.0
python -m tools.setup verify-version
```

See [`CLAUDE.md`](../CLAUDE.md) → **Build & Deploy** for the full
workflow including the Gradle alternative.

## Adding a tool

If you have a one-off script that genuinely doesn't fit inside
`tools/setup/` or `ghidra_scripts/`, drop a standalone file here with a
clear docstring and add it to the tree above. Most of the time, though,
the right home for new utility code is one of those two existing
locations.

---

All tools that talk to a running server connect to Ghidra MCP Server via
HTTP (default: `http://127.0.0.1:8089`).
